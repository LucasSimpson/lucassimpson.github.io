It's free for the first 14 days, and $10 a month afterwards. All accounts under $500 are free forever. We don't charge a % fee. Our users keep all their returns. How does HodlBot protect my API Keys? HodlBot only requires API keys with trade access, not withdrawal. This means nobody can withdraw funds from your Binance account. We encrypt all user data on our end with cryptographically secure hash functions. In addition, we engage in penetration testing and monitor logs to shut down trading in the case of suspicious activity. Does HodlBot take deposits? No. HodlBot is a software tool, not a fund or an exchange. Deposit your cryptocurrency on Binance. What kind of strategies can I choose? You can index the market with the HODL20 or you can create your own custom portfolio strategy. What happens after I activate a strategy? HodlBot will execute the trades on your Binance account so that your portfolio will match the composition of the strategy you've chosen. What is the HODL20? The HODL 20 is a cryptocurrency index that users can replicate with their own Binance account. The index weighs the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, and caps each coin at 10%. You can read more about it here . How does HodlBot rebalance my portfolio? HodlBot rebalances your portfolio by intelligently making a series of trades to get you towards your target allocation. The default period is one month but you can customize it. You can also manually trigger rebalances anytime. Does HodlBot charge a transacation fee for trades? HodlBot does not charge any transaction fees. Binance charges 0.1% transaction fee on trades. For the HODL 20, a 3 year historical back-test with monthly rebalances incurred an average of 0.26% from transaction fees per year. Does HodlBot trade everything in my account? Yes. When you use HodlBot, it will execute the strategy with all of the holdings in your Binance exchange account. If you wish to actively trade, you should do it on another exchange account. The other option is to place limit sells at ridiculous prices on coins you want to hold. HodlBot ignores open orders. What is the account minimum? There is no account minimum. We recommend $200 to protect users from Binance's minimum trading limit and make sure that diversified portfolios can be created properly. What are the tax implications of using HodlBot? In certain jurisdictions, buy sell actions on exchanges are taxable events. To comply with tax regulations, you will be able to export a log of HodlBot's transactions in csv format. What are the upcoming product changes? We're constantly updating our product. Our public roadmap is available [here(https://trello.com/b/udOwopV3/hodlbot-roadmap)].","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"getting-started/","text":"HodlBot Checklist Binance Account $200 in Cryptocurrency: Valid Trade-Only API Keys If you need help to set up your Binance account with at least $200 of cryptocurrencies, go here .

For example, if you wanted to keep a portfolio that is 50% ETH, and 50% BTC. The price of ETH relative to BTC may increase, causing your portfolio to become 70% weighted in ETH. During a rebalance, HodlBot sells some ETH and uses it to purchase BTC, therefore getting your portfolio back to its original target. Why Should I Rebalance my Portfolio? Markets are constantly in flux. Conditions change and return on assets vary. When this happens, investors have two choices: they can let their portfolios drift, or they can try correct its course. Left to their own devices, most investors choose to drift because they prefer the status quo. But by doing nothing, the weights of outperforming assets rise and weights of underperforming assets shrink. When asset allocation changes, so does risk. Therefore, investors who want to maintain their risk-return profile will opt to rebalance their portfolios. Methods of Portfolio Rebalancing There many different ways to rebalance a portfolio. Here they are, listed here in the order of most inflexible, to the most flexible. HodlBot supports periodic rebalancing, and active rebalancing. Periodic Rebalancing Portfolios are reset to their target allocations on a fixed time interval. This can be every week, month, quarter, or year. Assets that are overweight are sold to purchase underweighted assets until the portfolio reaches its target allocation. Threshold rebalancing Rebalances are triggered when certain assets deviate away from their target by more than the accepted range i.e. 5% or 10%. Range rebalancing This is the same as threshold rebalancing, except that asset allocations are rebalanced back to the maximum threshold instead of the target percentage. I.e. the target for asset A is 20%, it spikes to 28%, so then it is rebalanced to 25%. Volatility-based rebalancing Again, this is very similar to threshold rebalancing except that the thresholds for rebalancing are set according to each asset\u2019s expected volatility. The more volatile the asset, the wider the rebalancing threshold. Active rebalancing Portfolios are rebalanced based on human judgement. What is the Best Rebalancing Period? The consensus from finance academics clearly shows that there is no best rebalancing period. It is generally accepted that rebalancing will outperform a drifting portfolio given these conditions: Similar rates of returns across different asset classes Returns across different asset classes need to be similar in order for rebalancing to be effective. Otherwise, if one asset\u2019s growth is much lower, each rebalancing would push money from the winning asset into the losing one. Uncorrelated or negatively correlated assets Lower correlation causes the return on assets to offset each other, thereby reducing overall volatility. This accelerates the compounding of returns, and boosts portfolio values over time. The higher the correlation, the smaller the difference of returns across different asset classes must be in order for rebalancing to outperform holding. High variance within individual asset classes High variances leads to certain time periods where certain asset classes will significantly outperform the portfolio and other periods where where the same assets will significantly underperform the portfolio. When outperforming, a rebalance will take profits by selling. When underperforming, a rebalance will trigger a buy at the lower price. Mean-reversion happens on the same cycle that rebalancing takes place When assets have mean-reverting tendencies, they are more likely to appreciate if they have underperformed in the past. During a rebalance, additional funds are invested into underperforming assets. As performance reverts back to the mean, overall returns increase. Can I Customize My Rebalancing Period on HodlBot? Yes. Go to the settings tab, and click rebalancing. There you can set your preferred rebalancing period. The minimum value is 1 day.

The first is passive investing. Passive investors diversify their portfolio across the entire market, usually by means of a low-cost index fund. They don't try to beat the market. Instead they try to capture the risk return profile of the entire asset class. The second is active investing. Active investors use technical or fundamental indicators in an attempt to beat the average market performance. HodlBot supports both investing styles. The HODL20 Index - Passive Investing The HODL20 attempts to capture the risk and return of the entire cryptocurrency market. It takes the top 20 coins and assign each coin a % allocation based on their weighted market capitalization. Then it caps every coin to be at most 10% of the total portfolio value. Anything above 10% gets redistributed to all the coins below by weighted market capitalization until the entire sum of the portfolio adds up to 100%. We update the index every day based on new market cap data. Gist available here Above is the HODL20 allocation as of March 25, 2018. Here is a quick measures of how effectively it captures the market: The HODL 20 makes up ~87% of the cryptocurrency market. For comparison the S P 500 represents ~75% of the US stock market. Over a 3 year period, Bitcoin was up by a factor of 42x. HODL 20 with no rebalancing was up a factor of 51x and the HODL 20 with monthly rebalancing was up a factor of 164x. Rebalancing Periods for the HODL20 We update the index every day based on new market cap data. By default, HodlBot rebalances your portfolio every 4 weeks to keep it consistent with the HODL 20 index. We settled on 4 weeks as an appropriate rebalancing period, as longer periods do not track the market effectively while shorter periods incur higher transaction costs. You can customize this rebalancing period to be anything you like. There is some material floating online suggesting that more frequent rebalancing with cryptocurrencies is always better. We strongly disagree with that finding. Rebalancing is a well-researched area of finance. The consensus from academic literature states that more frequent rebalancing isn't always better. In fact, rebalancing can be worse than doing nothing at all for drifting markets. To read more about rebalancing, click here. Blacklist We realize that some of our users may really despise a coin within the top 20 by market cap. When you blacklist a coin, HodlBot will not purchase the coin. For the HODL20, HodlBot will replace it with the next highest coin by market cap. You can find the blacklist feature in the settings tab, under account. By default, we've blacklisted all stablecoins in the top 20, since they are by definition supposed to be stable and not change in price. Create Your Own Portfolio - Active Investing If you're not happy with the HODL20, HodlBot can help you create your own portfolio. Click over to the portfolios tab, to see all of your saved portfolios. To create a new one, simply hit the plus button. Begin by selecting what coins you'd like to hold, and setting their relative weights to each other. Once you have something interesting, you can run a historical backtest with HodlBot to see how this portfolio would have performed over time. When you're ready to create your portfolio, create a name and description for your new creation, and save it. Once you navigate back to the portfolios tab, you can make this new portfolio you've created your active strategy. A Few Notes on Create Your Own Portfolio Blacklist won't work on custom portfolios.

Dollar Cost Averaging with HodlBot Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment technique of buying a fixed dollar amount of a particular investment on a regular schedule, regardless of the price. The investor purchases more of an asset when prices are low and fewer of an asset when prices are high. Bernstein, a powerhouse in the field of academic finance, is a big supporter of the DCA method. DCA is not for people who consider themselves competent market-timers. Market-timers lump-sum in at whatever time they judge that the market is very likely to go up in the near future. And they get back out of the market when they judge that the market is very likely to go down in the near future. The DCA choice is for people who fear that the market may drop drastically at any time, but do not feel competent to judge whether that is more or less likely now than at some other time. It's easy to pair HodlBot with a dollar cost averaging strategy. Simply schedule a recurring deposit into your Binance account on a fixed time interval. Then, choose a rebalancing period that matches up with your deposit. E.g. Every 7 days for a deposit, and every 7 days for a rebalance. Another alternative is to simply manually rebalance. How to Keep HodlBot from Touching a Few Coins? By default, HodlBot uses all of the funds in your portfolio and puts it into the strategy you've selected. If you want HodlBot to ignore a few coins, there are two ways to do this. The easiest, and simplest way is to create an additional Binance account and use it for active trading.
