Click here to go to the next step .","title":"Choosing a Strategy - Next Steps"},{"location":"strategies/active-trading/","text":"Active Trading There are two broad schools of thought when it comes to investing. The first is passive investing. Passive investors diversify their portfolio across the entire market, usually by means of a low-cost index fund. They don't try to beat the market. Instead they try to capture the risk & return profile of the entire asset class. The second is active trading. Active traders try to beat the market by picking winners, and timing the market. Here's how HodlBot supports active traders. Create Your Own Portfolio With HodlBot, you can create your own set of custom cryptocurrency portfolios. 1. Pick Your Coins First, select what coins you would like to include in your portfolio. You can do this by simply looking up a coin by its symbol or name. This list contains all ~150 coins that are available on the Binance exchange. You can sort these coins by symbol, name, market capitalization, or 24H price change. Click the + sign to add all the coins you would like to include. Once a coin is included, it will be highlighted in purple. 2. Select Weighting Strategy Once you\u2019ve selected what coins you want to be included in your portfolio, it\u2019s time to decide how to weigh them. There are 3 weighting strategies to choose from: Fixed \u2014 assigns a constant weighting e.g. 10%. Market Cap \u2014 Assigns each coin a dynamic weighting based on its market capitalization Square Root Market Cap \u2014 Assigns each coin a dynamic weighting based on its square root market capitalization After a weighting strategy is selected, you can choose to modify the weighting any individual coin. Under market cap or square root market cap weightings, the ratios work in a similar manner. Setting BNB to 7, and every other coin to 1, means we will allocate weighting to BNB as if its market cap was 7x larger than it is. 3. Historical Backtest You don\u2019t want to jump into your strategy blind. So after you\u2019re done creating your portfolio, it\u2019s time to run a backtest against historical data to see how your strategy would have performed in the past. Fees and rebalances are taken into consideration for the backtest. For simplicity\u2019s sake, we\u2019ve scaled the backtest to start with a value of $1. Play around with your portfolio and the backtest until you\u2019re happy with the results. 4.

Here's how HodlBot supports passive investors. HODL Indices The HODL indices are total market indices designed to track the performance of the entire cryptocurrency market. Historically in equity markets, 80% of active professional traders fail to beat the index. We created the HODL indices to act as a sensible starting point for our users. On Binance the following starter indices are available: HODL10 (top 10) HODL20 (top 20) HODL30 (top 30) On Kraken the following starter indices are available: Kraken10 (top 10) To read more about indexing, and reasons why to passively invest, check out this blog . HODL10 Indexing methodology The HODL10 weighs the top 10 coins by square root market cap. Rebalancing Frequency The default rebalancing period is 28 days. But you can customize it to whatever. Special Considerations The market cap is not computed as an instantaneous number. Instead, the HODL10 uses an exponentially weighted moving average of market capitalization in an attempt to escape some of the day-to-day volatility in the market. This way, the constituents do not change as often. Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient with the Total Market: 0.99 HODL20 Indexing methodology The HODL20 weighs the top 20 coins by market capitalization but caps each individual holding to 10%. Anything above 10% gets redistributed to all the coins below by weighted market capitalization until the entire sum of the portfolio adds up to 100%. Rebalancing Frequency The default rebalancing period is 28 days. But you can customize it to whatever. Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient with the Total Market: 0.98 HODL30 Indexing Methodology The HODL30 consists of the top 30 coins by square root market cap. Rebalancing Period The default rebalancing period for the HODL30 is every 28 days. But you can customize this to whatever you\u2019d like. Special Considerations The market cap is not computed as an instantaneous number.

Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient with the Total Market: 0.99 Create Your Own Index If you're not happy with the HODL indices, and would like some additional customization, you can create your own index. 1. Choose the # of Coins in Your Portfolio & Set Percentage Caps The first step involves selecting the # of coins that will go into your portfolio. For example, ranks 1\u201320 capture the top 20 coins by market cap.You can also create mid-cap and small-cap indices with different configurations e.g. 20\u201340, 80\u2013100. Since the cryptocurrency market is very top-heavy, the top 3 coins make up 80% of the market capitalization,you may want to give lower ranked coins a higher weighting. One way to do this is by using percentage caps. A maximum cap denotes the maximum percentage any coin can be in your portfolio. Anything above a maximum cap gets redistributed to all the coins below by weighted market capitalization until the entire sum of the portfolio adds up to 100%.Conversely, a minimum cap specifies the smallest percentage of any coin you can have in your portfolio. 2. Select a Weighting Strategy Once you\u2019ve selected the # of coins to include and determined your percentage caps, it\u2019s time to select a weighting strategy. There are three options: Evenly weighted \u2014 Every coin in the portfolio has equal weighting. Market capitalization weighting \u2014Coins with larger market capitalizations are weighted more heavily. The percentage of any individual coin is the coin\u2019s market capitalization value divided by the total market capitalization value of all the coins in the portfolio. Square root market capitalization weighting \u2014The square root weighting strategy has a similar function to maximum percentage caps. Since the cryptocurrency market is top heavy, taking a square root of market capitalization shifts some of the weightings from the highest capped coins towards the lower-capped coins. 3. Backtest Your Strategy You don\u2019t want to jump into your strategy blind. So after you\u2019re done creating your index, it\u2019s time to run a backtest against historical data to see how your portfolio would have performed in the past.

Save Your Portfolio If you\u2019re happy with the results, you can save your portfolio & execute it right away. If you want to save it for later, you\u2019ll see it show up under your saved portfolios. You can switch between any as much as you\u2019d like. Coin Blacklist You can blacklist coins you don't want to have in your index. This will remove the coin from your portfolio and replace it with the next highest coin by market cap.","title":"Passive Investing"},{"location":"strategies/passive-investing/#passive-investing","text":"There are two broad schools of thought when it comes to investing.

For example, if you wanted to keep a portfolio that is 50% ETH, and 50% BTC. The price of ETH relative to BTC may increase, causing your portfolio to become 70% weighted in ETH. During a rebalance, HodlBot sells some ETH and uses it to purchase BTC, therefore getting your portfolio back to its original target. Why Should I Rebalance my Portfolio? Markets are constantly in flux. Conditions change and return on assets vary. When this happens, investors have two choices: they can let their portfolios drift, or they can try correct its course. Left to their own devices, most investors choose to drift because they prefer the status quo. But by doing nothing, the weights of outperforming assets rise and weights of underperforming assets shrink. When asset allocation changes, so does risk. Therefore, investors who want to maintain their risk-return profile will opt to rebalance their portfolios. Methods of Portfolio Rebalancing There many different ways to rebalance a portfolio. Here they are, listed here in the order of most inflexible, to the most flexible. HodlBot supports periodic rebalancing, and active rebalancing. Periodic Rebalancing Portfolios are reset to their target allocations on a fixed time interval. This can be every week, month, quarter, or year. Assets that are overweight are sold to purchase underweighted assets until the portfolio reaches its target allocation. Threshold rebalancing Rebalances are triggered when certain assets deviate away from their target by more than the accepted range i.e. 5% or 10%. Range rebalancing This is the same as threshold rebalancing, except that asset allocations are rebalanced back to the maximum threshold instead of the target percentage. I.e. the target for asset A is 20%, it spikes to 28%, so then it is rebalanced to 25%. Volatility-based rebalancing Again, this is very similar to threshold rebalancing except that the thresholds for rebalancing are set according to each asset\u2019s expected volatility. The more volatile the asset, the wider the rebalancing threshold. Active rebalancing Portfolios are rebalanced based on human judgement. What is the Best Rebalancing Period? Studies and our primary research shows that there is no best rebalancing period. We tested 10,000 portfolios and did an analysis on the subject in this article . When will Rebalancing Improve Returns? It is generally accepted that rebalancing will outperform a drifting portfolio given these conditions: Similar rates of returns across different asset classes Returns across different asset classes need to be similar in order for rebalancing to be effective. Otherwise, if one asset\u2019s growth is much lower, each rebalancing would push money from the winning asset into the losing one. Uncorrelated or negatively correlated assets Lower correlation causes the return on assets to offset each other, thereby reducing overall volatility. This accelerates the compounding of returns, and boosts portfolio values over time. The higher the correlation, the smaller the difference of returns across different asset classes must be in order for rebalancing to outperform holding. High variance within individual asset classes High variances leads to certain time periods where certain asset classes will significantly outperform the portfolio and other periods where where the same assets will significantly underperform the portfolio. When outperforming, a rebalance will take profits by selling. When underperforming, a rebalance will trigger a buy at the lower price. Mean-reversion happens on the same cycle that rebalancing takes place When assets have mean-reverting tendencies, they are more likely to appreciate if they have underperformed in the past. During a rebalance, additional funds are invested into underperforming assets. As performance reverts back to the mean, overall returns increase. Manual Rebalancing & Rebalancing Period Customization You can manually rebalance your portfolio and change the frequency HodlBot rebalances your portfolio. Disabling Rebalancing If you would like to disable rebalancing on HodlBot, you can either disable HodlBot services or set your rebalancing period to something ridiculous like 1000000 days.
